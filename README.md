# **Audio Spectrogram Analysis and Object Detection**

## Description:
This Python project focuses on analyzing audio data through various stages of processing, including applying filters, extracting signal spectra, generating spectrograms, and performing digital image processing techniques for object detection. The project employs threshold-based intensity analysis on the spectrogram to detect objects based on color characteristics. The final step involves comparing KeyPoints extracted from the resulting images, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of the processed audio data.

## Key Features:
- Audio preprocessing and spectral analysis
- Spectrogram generation and visualization
- Object detection using color-based thresholding
- KeyPoints extraction and comparison
- Comprehensive analysis of audio data through image processing techniques
